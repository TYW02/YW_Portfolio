California Housing Prices Data This dataset is based on data from the 1990 California census.
Goal of this project  Use California census data to build model of housing prices in the state.  The model should be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all other metric.    Data Metrics  Population Median Income Median Housing Prices For Each Block Group  Block Groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau sample data.</description>

Automated Machine Learning This project will take in user&amp;rsquo;s dataset and perform Exploratory Data Analysis as well as return the best fit model by comparing performance metrics across multiple different models.
What is Automated Machine Learning ?  AutoML is the way toward automating the start to finish the cycle of applying AI to certifiable issues. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is tied in with producing Machine Learning solutions for the data scientist without doing unlimited inquiries on data preparation, model selection, model hyperparameters, and model compression parameters.</description>

C300 Drowning Detection Due to a collaborative study found by Singapore General Hospital and Singapore Civil Defence Force, there are seven out of ten drowning cases in Singapore and four out of ten of these cases are children younger than ten years old.
Our project aims to create a solution to assist in the detection of early signs of drowning.</description>

Imagine that you are a medical researcher compiling data for a study. You have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y.
Part of your job is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness.</description>
